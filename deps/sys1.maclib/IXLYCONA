                         facility. Action: Physical connectivity must  *00798000

                         possible explanations of why the system does  *00801000

CONARSNFACILITYNOTINPOLICY EQU 2 Reason: The facility is not defined   *00804000
                         in the active policy. Action: Verify that the *00805000
                         set of facilities actually in use in the      *00806000
                         sysplex is correct and matches the            *00807000

CONARSNNOCONN EQU 3      Reason: Connectivity to the facility has been *00810000
                         lost. Action: Physical connectivity must be   *00811000
                         re-established. Then re-issue the connect     *00812000

CONARSNFACILITYFAILURE EQU 4 Reason: Facility has failed.               00814000
CONARSNSTRFAILURE EQU 5  Reason: Structure failed during the allocate  *00815000
                         processes.                                     00816000
CONARSNPARAMETERERROR EQU 6 Reason: The structure attributes were      *00817000
                         inconsistent with the model dependent         *00818000
                         attributes of the facility. Action: Change    *00819000
                         the attributes of the structure based on the  *00820000
                         model dependent limits returned for each      *00821000
                         facility.                                      00822000
CONARSNINVALIDSTRUCTURESIZE EQU 7 Reason: Structure size specified was *00823000
                         too small to allocate the structure with the  *00824000
                         attributes specified. This may be the result  *00825000
                         of the initial allocation size being too      *00826000
                         small to accommodate the maximum structure    *00827000
                         and/or the maximum storage-class memory       *00828000
                         associated with the structure. One possible   *00829000
                         scenario is that the initial structure size   *00830000
                         was calculated based on a CF with a CFLEVEL   *00831000
                         different from where the structure was         00832000
*                        allocated previously. ConaFacilityMinReqSize  *00833000

                         allocate the structure in this facility with  *00835000
                         the requested attributes. Action: Increase    *00836000
                         the structure size specified on IXLCONN, or   *00837000
                         increase the initial size in the CFRM policy.  00838000
CONARSNALLOCNOTPERMITTED EQU 8 Reason: New structures cannot be        *00839000

                         active policy. Reasons: the coupling facility *00841000
                         is being removed from the active policy, the  *00842000
                         coupling facility has failed, the coupling    *00843000
                         facility is in the policy reconciliation      *00844000
                         process, or the coupling facility is in       *00845000
                         maintenance mode.                              00846000

CONARSNINSUFFICIENTSPACE EQU 11 Reason: There was not sufficient space *00851000
                         in the facility to allocate the structure.    *00852000
                         ConaFacilityMinReqSize is set to the minimum  *00853000
                         storage required to allocate the structure in *00854000
                         this facility with the requested attributes.  *00855000
                         Action: Make sure there is a facility in the  *00856000
                         preference list with sufficient space.         00857000
CONARSNREBLDOTHER EQU 12 Reason: LOCATION=OTHER was specified on the   *00858000
                         rebuild request. Since the original structure *00859000
                         was allocated in this coupling facility, the  *00860000
                         system did not use this coupling facility     *00861000
                         when trying to allocate the new structure for *00862000
                         rebuild. If the structure allocation failed,  *00863000
                         make sure there is another suitable coupling  *00864000
                         facility in the structure's preference list.   00865000
CONARSNREBLDUSERSTOOSMALL EQU 13 Reason: Facility was not selected for *00866000
                         a rebuild connect request because the         *00867000
                         facility does not support a number of users   *00868000

                         connection ID for the original structure.      00870000
CONARSNINSUFFCONNECTIVITY EQU 14 Reason: Facility was not selected     *00871000
                         because it did not provide the required       *00872000
                         facility connectivity, as specified by the    *00873000

CONARSNPREFERREDCFSELECTED EQU 15 Reason: Facility was not selected    *00875000

CONARSNREBLDDUPLEXOTHER EQU 16 Reason: A previous duplexing rebuild    *00878000
                         was stopped by an operator, the CFRM policy   *00879000

                         and CFRM reduplexed (or attempted to          *00881000
                         reduplex) the structure. It could not be      *00882000
                         placed in this facility because the operator  *00883000
                         requested that it be moved out of the         *00884000
                         facility by stopping the previous rebuild.    *00885000
                         Action: Make sure there is another suitable   *00886000
                         facility in the preference list.               00887000
CONARSNFACILITYPOPCFNOTSUITABLE EQU 17 Reason: Facility was not        *00888000
                         selected because it was not as suitable a     *00889000

CONARSNIMPLIEDREBLDOTHER EQU 18 Reason: Facility was not selected      *00892000
                         because it holds the rebuild old structure,   *00893000
                         and since there is no policy chg pending, the *00894000
                         rebuild assumes that a MOVE of the structure  *00895000
                         is required                                    00896000
CONARSNINSUFFCFLEVELUSER EQU 19 Reason: The coupling facility CFLEVEL  *00897000

                         an original connector or for the current set  *00899000

                         MVS managed process doing the rebuild.         00904000
CONARSNINSUFFUSERLIMIT EQU 21 Reason: Facility was not selected        *00905000
                         because it does not support as many           *00906000

CONARSNSTRLIMITSTOOSMALL EQU 22 Reason: Facility was not selected      *00908000
                         because its structure limits (e.g., number of *00909000
                         castout classes, storage classes, list        *00910000

CONARSNBADALLOCATERESULTS EQU 23 Reason: An attempt to allocate a      *00913000
                         structure in the facility resulted in a       *00914000
